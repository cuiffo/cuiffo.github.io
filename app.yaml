# Handlers define how to route requests to your application.
handlers:

# App Engine serves and caches static files contained in the listed directories
# (and subdirectories). Uncomment and set the directory as needed.
#- url: /compiled
#  static_dir: client

#- url: /(.*\.(gif|png|jpg))$
#  static_files: images/\1
#  upload: images/.*\.(gif|png|jpg)$

#- url: /(.*\.(js))$
#  static_files: compiled/\1
#  upload: compiled/.*\.(gif|png|jpg)$
- url: /$
  static_files: public/index.html
  upload: public/index.html


# Handle folder urls by serving the index.html page inside.
- url: /(.*)/$
  static_files: public/\1/index.html
  upload: public/.*/index.html

# Handle nearly every other file by just serving it.

# This handler tells app engine how to route requests to a WSGI application.
# The script value is in the format <path.to.module>.<wsgi_application>
# where <wsgi_application> is a WSGI application object.
