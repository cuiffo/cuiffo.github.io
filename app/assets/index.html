                Here's another late in the semester love story! Joy and Cecilia also met during the last 2 months of freshmen year and it was love at first sight. From their mutual adoration of karaoke and their ability to talk about all things girly, they spend hours just jumping from topic to topic. Technically, they met first so Eric is actually the "other woman".

                I should probably write something tame here since our mothers will be reading this and then WeChatting each other about it. Cecilia and Denise met when they were, uh...studying. Yes, many good times were had at the...library. 
                (Pssst, Denise, scroll over here)
                Just kidding - we were pretty good for the most part. Minus that Chinatown thing. And Canada. And I guess most of high school. And college. Ok, I should probably stop here.

                Cecilia and Ivy met at Chanel as interns during college and were fortunately reunited a year later at the same company. They started as coworkers and ended up being friends who sat in Central Park planning Cecilia's wedding before Ivy even knew she was going to be a bridesmaid. Cecilia always knew she needed Ivy in her bridal party because she's the one who will say, "uh, the stitching on that sleeve is like 1 millimeter off. Can you get the bride a new one?"

                Let's see...Janice and Cecilia have probably known each other for, I dunno, like a million years? Yeah, that's probably a pretty good estimate. They've seen each other go through weird high school phases and have weathered some pretty bad storms together. In the end, they'll always have each other and if that doesn't bond two people together, then I don't know what does!

                Cecilia and Tawnie have known each other for almost a year, but hey, the heart wants what the heart wants! They started off as office buddies along with Ivy and can't really live without doing a shopping spree or karaoke session together every so often. If they didn't have each other, who else could convince them that $800 boots are totally worth it?

            Unfortunately, some stereotypes just aren't true and the girl was frantically searching for someone to help her prep for her math final. Only one smooth, charming genius stepped forward to seize the opportunity. "Uh, yeah, I can math good!"

            <br>
            <br>
            Who could resist that charm? From then on, they were inseparable.

            Before they knew it, 4 years had passed. 
            <br>
            <br>
            On August 15th, 2015, Cecilia was suddenly blindfolded and whisked away during a girls’ night out. When the blindfold came off, she was sitting in front of a laptop with the words 'Press to Start', which launched the retelling of all Eric &amp; Cecilia's adventures through 8-bit form. After playing through the game Eric created for her, Cecilia stepped out onto a rose and candle filled balcony to see the only person in the world who could truly make her happy. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The perfect timing brought two weird people together. What if Cecilia had paid attention in class? What if Eric wasn't goofing off in the lounge? Fortunately, the world may never know!
